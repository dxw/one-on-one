# Welcome to your 1:1 repository

This is a personal repository. It will house all 1:1 notes, documented goals /
growth things, and anything else important that comes up between you and your
manager.

## How does it work?

Meeting notes are saved in this private repo. They are very helpful to refer
back to for both of us during review season. Only the two of us have access to
this repository. If you get a new manager, you can transfer the repository over
so that you can have a consistent process, and so that your new manager can have
access to any previous notes.

Every Monday, a GitHub action creates a PR within a markdown file containing
questions about the week ahead. We can each add notes to this as they come to
mind, and then, during our 1:1, reference them and add new notes and to-dos. At
the end of the week, you can review and merge the PR, marking the notes as seen
and complete.

## Steps for using this template

1. [Create a new private repository from this template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

   The report should do this, so the repository follows them across managers.

1. Invite the manager to the repository as an admin so they have full permission
   to modify and update the repository

   It's a shared resource to aid our communication.

1. Update [these two lines](.github/workflows/one-to-one-notes.yml#L34-35) with
   the manager and reports' GitHub usernames

   This will assign the fortnightly PRs to both of you so that they show up in
   your notifications.
