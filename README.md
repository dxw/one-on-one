# Welcome to your 1:1 repository

This is a personal repository. It will house all 1:1 notes, documented goals /
growth things, and anything else important that comes up between you and your
manager.

## How does it work?

Meeting notes are saved in this private repo. They are very helpful to refer
back to for both of us during review season. Only the two of us have access to
this repository. If you get a new manager, you can transfer the repository over
so that you can have a consistent process, and so that your new manager can have
access to any previous notes.

Every other Monday (configurable), a GitHub action creates a PR within a
markdown file containing questions about the period ahead. We can each add notes
to this as they come to mind, and then, during our 1:1, reference them and add
new notes and to-dos. At the end of the period, you can review and merge the PR,
marking the notes as seen and complete.

## Steps for using this template

1. [Create a new private repository from this template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

   You (the report) should do this, so the repository follows you across
   managers.

1. Invite me (the manager) to the repository as an admin so I have full
   permission to modify and update the repository

   It's a shared resource to aid our communication.

1. Update [these two lines](.github/workflows/one-to-one-notes.yml#L34-35) with
   the our GitHub usernames

   This will assign the PRs to both of us so that they show up in our
   notifications.
